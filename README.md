# 📝 Todo List App by Joshua Tiller

A simple, clean, and responsive **Todo List App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It's structured for readability, reusability, and learning best practices through hands-on coding.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks via form input
- ✅ Delete tasks with a single click
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (🔴 → 🟢)
- ✅ Visually separate active and completed tasks
- ✅ Clear UI with dark mode styling
- ✅ Responsive layout using Flexbox
- ✅ Input validation (no empty tasks allowed)

## 📂 File Structure

├── index.html # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css # CSS styles for layout and theme
└── script.js # JavaScript logic for task management


---

## 💡 How It Works

- User types a task and clicks "Add To List"
- A task `<li>` is created with:
  - The task text
  - A 🗑️ delete button
  - A 🔴 complete button
- Clicking 🔴 moves the task to the completed section and turns into 🟢
- The task is styled with `.completed` class
- Tasks can be removed any time using the 🗑️ button

## 🎨 UI Design Highlights

- **Dark background** with high-contrast pink and white text
- Responsive card-style containers using Flexbox
- Hover effects and button transitions for interactivity
- Accessible label and input structures

## 🧠 Built For Learning

This project was built using a **project-based learning** approach rather than relying on tutorials or textbooks. It encourages:

- DOM manipulation practice
- Event handling
- Clean and semantic HTML/CSS structure
- Functional, readable JavaScript
- Logical separation of features

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- [ ] LocalStorage support (persist tasks after reload)
- [ ] Task editing
- [ ] Filter: All / Active / Completed
- [ ] Animations for task transitions
- [ ] Unit testing for logic
